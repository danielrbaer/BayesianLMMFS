Description: This R package implements a Bayesian linear mixed model for bi-level feature selection via a Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling algorithm; 
	this model is for the data scenario where we have time-invariant feature data and possibly irregularly-spaced longitudinal outcome data; 
	this model specifies time-varying feature parameters, and allows for the incorporation of group structure into the feature selection process.
